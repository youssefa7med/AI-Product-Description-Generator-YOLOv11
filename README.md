   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd goods-detector-yolov11
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file with the following variables:
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
   TTS_PASSWORD=your_tts_password
   HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
   ```

### Model Setup

1. **Download the Trained Model**:
   - Place the `best.pt` file (trained YOLOv11 model) in the project directory
   - Ensure the model file is accessible by the application

2. **Verify Model Loading**:
   ```bash
   python -c "from ultralytics import YOLO; model = YOLO('best.pt'); print('Model loaded successfully')"
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Gradio Interface**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the displayed local URL
